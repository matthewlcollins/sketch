-Create 16x16 grid of square divs
this will be flexbox using dom manipulation 
using a for loop in a function to create the grid.
This will be inside a container div for best practice,
this one can be written in the html file

Set a hover effect so that the grid divs change color on mouse over,
also leaving a pixilated trail through it, this will most likely use event listeners

Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the 
number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be 
removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before
(e.g., 960px wide) so that youâ€™ve got a new sketch pad. 

To Do:

-Create function to create grid using for loop and dom manipulation to
create the div grid
-The above function will later have a prompt that will allow the user to
input a number of squares to be used, this will clear the old grid and replace with
this grid so it will have a similar loop as above getting num from user input
-Create function that will change the div colors on mouse hover
-Create function that will leave a pixel trail following the mouse, this will probably also
be a hover event

extra credit:
-make it so the pixel trail is rng colors

-dditionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square
 by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.
